# Quant_trading_system

**Modular RL + Risk Control + C++ High-Frequency Trading System**

This repository implements a modular, extensible trading system that combines:
- ‚úÖ Reinforcement Learning (e.g. PPO, DQN)
- ‚úÖ Rule-based baseline strategies
- ‚úÖ Risk control logic (drawdown limits, stop-loss)
- ‚úÖ High-frequency C++ inference using `libtorch`
- ‚úÖ Real-time execution via Python interfaces

## üß† Project Objective

The goal is to build a production-ready research pipeline for RL-based trading systems that:
- Learns and generates alpha through RL or rule-based logic
- Controls downside risk via robust filters
- Executes orders through real-time inference + broker API
- Integrates cleanly with both Python (training/logic) and C++ (execution)
